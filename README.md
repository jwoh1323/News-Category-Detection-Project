**News Category Detection**

Social media platforms have come under unwanted scrutiny in recent years for their role in perpetuating online misinformation, so-called “fake news.” As of this writing in May 2020, a flood of conspiracy theories and falsehoods about the Covid-19 pandemic have become a problem for Facebook and Twitter (Cellan-Jones 2020). In this project, I discuss a variety of means that have been proposed for social media companies to attempt to automate fake news detection. I look at the great difficulty involved in obtaining labeled training data for supervised learning to train deep neural networks in this task, and experience this difficulty first-hand as I unsuccessfully try to train a model to detect misinformation using a public dataset.

As a related surrogate task, I train a deep recurrent neural network to identify the topic of news articles across a wide range of subjects, achieving 75% test accuracy across 40 categories of news stories, and test how well it generalizes to new news articles that I scraped from the internet. I find that the model generalizes well even to stories that come from a different publication and time period. Finally, I discuss how such a model can serve as one facet of a technological arsenal in the fight against fake news.
